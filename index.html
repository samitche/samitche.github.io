    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Edit to make more relaxed and less formal</p>
    <p>PROFESSIONAL</p>
    <p>
      I received a BA in Economics from Hendrix College in 2010, where I was a Miller Center Service Scholar. 
      I received a MPhil in International Peace Studies from TCD in 2011 and a MSc in Economics from TCD in 2012. 
      I am currently a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin under the supervision of Prof. John O'Hagan. My main 
      research interests are urban economics, economic history, and cultural economics. I was also 
      one of three young researchers in Ireland selected to attend the 5th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting of 
      Economic Sciences in 2015.

    <p>PERSONAL</p>
    <p>I was born in and raised in the USA, but I fell in love with travel during my undergrad, where I 
    had the opportunity to study in Japan and Sweden and travel extensively throughout Europe. After undergrad, 
    I moved to Ireland...In my spare time, I enjoy baking cakes and pies, swimming and Krav Maga.  I recently started 
    learning Italian and Portuguese.</p>
