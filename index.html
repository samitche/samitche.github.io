    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      My current research explores the synergies from geographic clustering (or co-location) of literary artists in
      historical
      UK and Ireland, combining elements from cultural economics, urban economics and economic history.
    </p>
    <p>
      My doctoral research is centered around a unique, purpose-built dataset on 370 authors associated with British and
      Celtic literature since 1700. My initial analysis involved tracking patterns of individual migration, identifying
      the cities in which authors tend to cluster (or co-locate) and estimating the productivity gains associated with
      this literary agglomeration. In my next paper, I empirically determine the local determinants of these
      agglomeration effects, focusing on mechanisms theoretically associated with learning-based agglomeration
      economies. In my final paper, I propose social network analysis as a new, useful and relatively unexplored channel
      of tacit knowledge exchange (i.e. a mechanism through which agglomeration gains occur.) To complete this analysis,
      I collected and analysed additional data on friendship networks and membership in literary societies and combined
      this with data on the spatial distribution of authors.
    </p>

      <strong>London Calling? Agglomeration Economies in Literature since 1700</strong>
      <i>(Job Market Paper - <a href="AgglomerationInLiterature.pdf">pdf</a>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper utilises a unique, purpose-built panel dataset on prominent authors in the UK and Ireland born
      1700–1925 to estimate the productivity gains associated with agglomeration of an industry with few capital
      requirements and no apparent need to cluster geographically. We find the average author experiences productivity
      gains of 10.68% per annum when residing in London, controlling for spatial sorting by skill level. While we do
      not find evidence of dynamic learning effects, we confirm that our results are not driven by a dynamic spatial
      self-selection process or authors who strategically build a portfolio of works before moving to London and
      publishing in quick succession.

      <strong>Local Determinants of Agglomeration Effects in Learning-Based Economies:
      Authorship in the UK and Ireland since 1700</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper utilises a unique, purpose-build panel dataset to analyse local determinants of agglomeration
      effects among 370 prominent authors in the UK and Ireland since 1700. This paper examines learning and 
      knowledge-sharing mechanisms, including size and density effects and human capital externalities.  The 
      within-estimator suggests per annum productivity increases by 9.01% for each 10 additional authors residing 
      in the author’s location.  However, there is no evidence of productivity gains from increased concentration 
      of literary activity within London, the only major literary cluster during the time period. Overall, 
      peer-quality increases productivity, but authors receive net losses when residing in London, providing evidence
      that the ‘burden of knowledge’ mechanism exists exclusively in highly competitive locations.

    <h1>About</h1>
 
    <p>
      I received a BA in Economics from Hendrix College in 2010, where I was a Miller Center Service Scholar.
      I received a MPhil in International Peace Studies from TCD in 2011 and a MSc in Economics from TCD in 2012.
      I am currently a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin under the supervision of Prof. John O'Hagan. My main
      research interests are urban economics, economic history, and cultural economics. I was also
      one of three young researchers in Ireland selected to attend the 5th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting of
      Economic Sciences in 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
    When not researching, I train in swimming and krav maga - if only to balance my love for baking!
    I enjoy travel and had the opportunity to study in Japan and Sweden during undergrad before moving to Ireland for
    my postgraduate degrees.  I also recently started learning Italian and Portuguese.
