    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      My current research explores the synergies from geographic clustering (or co-location) of literary artists in
      historical
      UK and Ireland, combining elements from cultural economics, urban economics and economic history.
    </p>
    <p>
      My doctoral research is centered around a unique, purpose-built dataset on 370 authors associated with British and
      Celtic literature since 1700. My initial analysis involved tracking patterns of individual migration, identifying
      the cities in which authors tend to cluster (or co-locate) and es- timating the productivity gains associated with
      this literary agglomeration. In my next paper, I empirically determine the local determinants of these
      agglomeration effects, focusing on mechanisms theoretically associated with learning-based agglomeration
      economies. In my final paper, I propose social network analysis as a new, useful and relatively unexplored channel
      of tacit knowledge exchange (i.e. a mechanism through which agglomeration gains occur.) To complete this analysis,
      I collected and analysed additional data on friendship networks and membership in literary societies and combined
      this with data on the spatial distribution of authors.

      <strong>London Calling? Agglomeration Economies in Literature since 1700</strong>
      <i>(Job Market Paper - <a href="AgglomerationInLiterature.pdf">pdf</a>)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper utilises a unique, purpose-built panel dataset on prominent authors in the UK and Ireland born
      1700â€“1925 to estimate the productivity gains associated with agglomeration of an industry with few capital
      requirements and no apparent need to cluster geographically. We find the average author experiences productivity
      gains of 10.68% per annum when re- siding in London, controlling for spatial sorting by skill level. While we do
      not find evidence of dynamic learning effects, we confirm that our results are not driven by a dynamic spatial
      self-selection process or authors who strategically build a portfolio of works before moving to London and
      publishing in quick succession.

    <p>
      I received a BA in Economics from Hendrix College in 2010, where I was a Miller Center Service Scholar.
      I received a MPhil in International Peace Studies from TCD in 2011 and a MSc in Economics from TCD in 2012.
      I am currently a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin under the supervision of Prof. John O'Hagan. My main
      research interests are urban economics, economic history, and cultural economics. I was also
      one of three young researchers in Ireland selected to attend the 5th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting of
      Economic Sciences in 2015.

      PERSONAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in and raised in the USA, but I fell in love with travel during my undergrad, where I
      had the opportunity to study in Japan and Sweden and travel extensively throughout Europe. After undergrad,
      I moved to Ireland...In my spare time, I enjoy baking cakes and pies, swimming and Krav Maga. I recently started
      learning Italian and Portuguese.
